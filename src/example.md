Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction.

$$f(k,n,p) = \Pr(k;n,p) = \Pr(X = k) = \binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$$


The [cumulative distribution function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution#Cumulative_distribution_function) can be expressed as:

$$F(k;n,p) = \Pr(X \le k) = \sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor k \rfloor} {n\choose i}p^i(1-p)^{n-i}$$
